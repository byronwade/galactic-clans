    executeFallback(): Promise<boolean>;
    getSystemState(): any;
    validateState(): boolean;
    resetToSafeState(): Promise<void>;
    getHealthStatus(): SystemHealth;
}
```

### Recovery Strategies

2. **Secondary Recovery**: Reset UI components
3. **Fallback Recovery**: Enable offline mode
4. **Emergency Recovery**: Safe state activation

### Error Categories

- NETWORK: Connectivity and data sync issues
- GRAPHICS: Rendering and visual problems
- AUDIO: Sound system failures
- INPUT: Control and interaction problems

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Resource Management
- **Asset Preloading**: Critical assets loaded during initialization
- **Memory Pooling**: Reuse UI elements to prevent garbage collection
- **Lazy Loading**: Non-critical assets loaded on-demand
- **Texture Optimization**: Multiple quality levels for different devices

### Rendering Optimization

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
```typescript
describe('GameStateManager', () => {
    let stateManager: GameStateManager;
    
    beforeEach(() => {
        stateManager = new GameStateManager();
    });
    
    it('should transition to main menu on startup', async () => {
        await stateManager.initialize();
        expect(stateManager.getCurrentState()).toBe(GameState.MAIN_MENU);
    });
    
    it('should handle invalid transitions gracefully', async () => {
        await stateManager.initialize();
        const result = await stateManager.transitionTo(GameState.IN_GAME);
        expect(result).toBe(false);
    });
});
```

### Integration Testing
```typescript
describe('Complete UI Flow', () => {
    it('should complete full game flow', async () => {
        const game = new CosmicGame();
        await game.initialize();
        
        // Simulate user starting single player
        window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('startSinglePlayer'));
        
        // Wait for loading to complete
        await waitForEvent('loadingComplete');
        
        // Verify game started
        expect(game.getCurrentState()).toBe(GameState.IN_GAME);
    });
});
```
