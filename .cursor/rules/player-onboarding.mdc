# Player Onboarding & Tutorial

The first-time user experience (FTUE) is critical for player retention. This document outlines the plan for onboarding new players into the world of **Galactic Clans**. The goal is to guide players through the core mechanics without overwhelming them.

## Onboarding Principles

-   **Guided, Not Forced**: The tutorial should guide players, but allow for exploration.
-   **Contextual Learning**: Introduce concepts when the player needs them.
-   **Reward Progression**: Completing tutorial steps should grant small resource rewards to reinforce positive actions.

## Tutorial Flow

The tutorial will be a series of quests presented by an AI companion, "COSMOS."

    A[Start Game] --> B(Welcome to Galactic Clans!<br/>Let's build your first Mine.);
    B --> C{Player builds a Mine};
    C --> D(Great! Now collect<br/>your first Minerals.);
    D --> E{Player collects Minerals};
    E --> F(Build a Barracks<br/>to train your first troops.);
    F --> G{Player builds Barracks};
    G --> H(Train a squad of Grunts.);
    H --> I{Player trains Grunts};
    I --> J(Let's try a simulated raid!<br/>Attack the nearby Rogue Drone.);
    J --> K{Player completes simulated raid};
    K --> L(Congratulations, Commander!<br/>You are now ready to explore the galaxy.<br/>**Tutorial Complete**);
```

## Post-Tutorial

-   **Guided Goals**: After the main tutorial, COSMOS will offer optional quests that guide the player toward mid-game goals, such as:
    -   "Join or Create a Clan"
    -   "Upgrade your Town Hall to Level 3"
    -   "Scout a Neighboring System"
-   **Help Menu**: A comprehensive, searchable in-game guide will be available at all times for players who want to learn more about specific features.
