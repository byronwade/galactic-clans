# Game Economy Design

This document provides a detailed blueprint for the economy of **Galactic Clans**. The goal is to create a balanced and engaging economic loop that rewards active play, supports long-term progression, and avoids creating an unfair pay-to-win environment.

## Guiding Principles

-   **Player-Driven**: The economy should be driven by player actions: building, upgrading, and raiding.
-   **Balanced Progression**: Costs and rewards should be carefully balanced to provide a smooth progression curve.
-   **Sink & Faucet Management**: We must carefully manage resource generation (faucets) and resource spending (sinks) to prevent inflation or deflation.

## Core Resources

-   **Minerals**: The primary building material, generated by planetary mines. Used for constructing buildings and training basic units.
-   **Energy**: A secondary resource, generated by solar collectors. Used for advanced units, technology research, and maintaining structures.
-   **Dark Matter**: A premium and rare resource, acquired through special events, high-level raids, and as a reward for accomplishments. Used to speed up timers and purchase exclusive cosmetic items.

## Economic Loop Diagram

This diagram illustrates the core flow of resources in the game.

## Initial Balancing (To Be Tuned)

| Item              | Mineral Cost | Energy Cost | Build Time |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| Town Hall Lvl 1   | 1,000        | 0           | 60s        |
| Mine Lvl 1        | 100          | 10          | 30s        |
| Grunt Unit (x10)  | 500          | 50          | 120s       |

*Note: These values are placeholders for initial implementation and will be tuned extensively during playtesting.*
