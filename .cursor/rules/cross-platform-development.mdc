# Cross-Platform Development

Galactic Clans is a cross-platform game, and it is essential that we maintain a consistent and high-quality experience across all supported platforms.

## Core Principles

-   **Code Once, Run Anywhere**: The majority of the game's code should be platform-agnostic. Use abstractions to handle platform-specific functionality.
-   **Platform-Specific Implementations**: For features that require platform-specific APIs (e.g., file system access, notifications), create separate implementations for each platform and use a factory or a similar pattern to select the correct implementation at runtime.
-   **Consistent User Experience**: While the UI may be adapted for different screen sizes and input methods, the core user experience should be consistent across all platforms.

## Input Handling

-   **Abstract Input Layer**: Create an abstract input layer that can handle input from a variety of sources, including mouse, keyboard, touch, and gamepads.
-   **Platform-Specific Controls**: Provide default control schemes that are appropriate for each platform. Allow players to customize their controls.

## UI

-   **Responsive Design**: The UI must be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios.
-   **Platform-Specific UI Elements**: While the overall UI should be consistent, it may be necessary to use platform-specific UI elements (e.g., date pickers, file dialogs) to provide a more native look and feel.

## Future Launcher

-   The desktop versions of the game will eventually be launched through a dedicated launcher. The game should be designed to be launched from an external application.
