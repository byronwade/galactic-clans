# Art Style Guide

This document is the visual companion to the `performance-and-visuals.mdc` rule. It provides specific examples and guidelines to ensure a consistent low-poly art style for **Galactic Clans**.

## Core Principles

-   **Simplicity**: Focus on strong, readable silhouettes.
-   **Flat Shading**: No smooth shading. Emphasize the geometric facets of the models.
-   **Vibrant, Limited Colors**: Use a consistent color palette to define biomes and factions.

## Color Palette

-   **Primary Colors**: Used for large surfaces like terrain and buildings.
    -   Faction A (Player): `[#4A90E2]` (Blue), `[#F5A623]` (Gold)
    -   Faction B (Rival): `[#E03C31]` (Red), `[#4A4A4A]` (Dark Grey)
    -   AI / Rogue: `[#7ED321]` (Green)
-   **Accent Colors**: Used for details, lights, and effects.

## Modeling Guidelines

-   **Polygon Budget**:
    -   Small props & units: < 200 triangles
    -   Medium buildings: < 500 triangles
    -   Large centerpiece buildings (Town Hall): < 1000 triangles
-   **No Detailed Textures**: Rely on vertex colors and small, reusable color palettes/atlases for all model coloration.
-   **Example - Grunt Unit**:
    -   *A simple, blocky humanoid figure. The weapon is part of the main mesh to save polygons. Color is applied via vertex painting to denote faction.*

## UI & Iconography

-   **Style**: Flat, minimalist, and vector-based.
-   **Icons**: Icons should be simple and immediately recognizable. Use a consistent stroke width and style.
-   **Example - Mineral Icon**:
    -   *A simple, faceted crystal shape using the primary blue and a lighter accent.*
