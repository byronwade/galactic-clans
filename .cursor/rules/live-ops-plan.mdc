# Live Operations (Live Ops) Plan

A successful game launch is just the beginning. This document outlines our strategy for managing **Galactic Clans** post-launch to ensure long-term player engagement and retention.

## Guiding Principles

-   **Consistent Cadence**: Deliver new content and events on a regular, predictable schedule.
-   **Community-Focused**: Actively listen to and engage with our player community.
-   **Data-Informed**: Use analytics to understand player behavior and make informed decisions.

## Content & Event Cadence

Our goal is to provide a steady stream of new experiences for our players.

-   **Weekly**:
    -   **Mini-Events**: Small-scale events with simple objectives and rewards (e.g., "Train 50 Tank units for a resource bonus").
    -   **Leaderboard Resets**: Weekly resets for individual and clan leaderboards with small rewards for top performers.
-   **Monthly**:
    -   **Major Events**: Themed, multi-day events with unique mechanics and exclusive cosmetic rewards (e.g., "The Pirate Invasion").
    -   **New Battle Pass Season**: A new Battle Pass will launch on the first of every month.
-   **Quarterly**:
    -   **Major Content Updates**: Significant updates that introduce new units, buildings, game modes, or expand the game world.

## Community Management

-   **Communication Channels**: We will actively engage with players on Discord, Reddit, and our official forums.
-   **Developer Updates**: A monthly blog post or video will share insights into upcoming features and the state of the game.
-   **Player Feedback**: We will use surveys and community polls to gather feedback and involve players in the decision-making process.

## Monetization & Economy Tuning

-   **Special Offers**: Time-limited bundles and offers will be introduced around major events and holidays.
-   **Economy Monitoring**: We will continuously monitor the game's economy to identify and address any imbalances.
-   **A/B Testing**: New features and offers may be A/B tested with a small segment of the player base before a full rollout.
