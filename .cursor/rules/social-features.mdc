# Social Features Design

Beyond the clan system, **Galactic Clans** will include several features to encourage social interaction and community building.

## Core Social Features

-   **Global & Regional Chat**: Public chat channels for all players, with options for regional channels to facilitate communication in different languages.
-   **Private Messaging**: Players can send direct, private messages to others.
-   **Friends List**: Players can add up to 200 friends.
    -   See their online status.
    -   Visit their home solar system.
    -   Quickly invite them to a clan.
-   **In-Game Mail System**: An asynchronous messaging system used for:
    -   Sending and receiving clan invitations.
    -   Receiving system notifications (e.g., "Your building has finished upgrading").
    -   Distributing event rewards.

## Player Profiles

Every player will have a public profile that others can view. It will display:

-   Player Name & Level
-   Clan Name & Badge
-   Total Accomplishment Points
-   Current Army Composition
-   A customizable "Bio" section.

## Social Interaction Flow
