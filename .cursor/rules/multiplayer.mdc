# Multiplayer & Networking

Galactic Clans is a multiplayer game, so it is critical that we have a robust, secure, and efficient multiplayer implementation.

## Core Architecture

-   **Authoritative Server**: The server is the single source of truth for all game state and logic. This is the foundation of our anti-cheat strategy. All significant game events (raids, clan interactions) must be managed and validated on the server.
-   **Client-Side Prediction**: To provide a responsive experience, clients should predict the results of player actions. The server's state will always be the source of truth, and the client's predicted state will be corrected as necessary.
-   **Server-Side Physics**: All physics simulations must be run on the server.

## Networking & Data Synchronization

-   **Efficient State Synchronization**: Use efficient state synchronization techniques to minimize bandwidth usage. Send deltas (changes) instead of the full game state whenever possible.
-   **Time Tokens and Hashing**: Use time tokens and hashing to ensure state synchronization is stable and secure.
-   **Batch Remote Events**: Batch multiple updates into a single remote event to reduce overhead.
-   **Selective Replication**: Only replicate data that clients need to know about.

## Freeroam Data Streaming

-   **On-Demand Streaming**: When a player is in freeroam mode, the client should only request data for the solar systems that are currently in view.
-   **Low-Resolution Data for Distant Systems**: For distant solar systems, the server should send a low-resolution version of the data (e.g., number of planets, owner's name).
-   **Prioritize Player's Own Data**: The player's own solar systems and assets should always be prioritized and sent at the highest resolution.

## Matchmaking

-   **Skill-Based Matchmaking**: Implement a skill-based matchmaking system to create fair and balanced matches.
-   **Party System**: Players should be able to form parties and join matches together.
