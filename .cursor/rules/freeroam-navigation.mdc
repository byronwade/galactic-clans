# Freeroam Navigation, UI & UX

The freeroam navigation system is a core feature of **Galactic Clans**, allowing players to seamlessly explore the universe. This system must be intuitive, performant, and work across all supported platforms, with a user-friendly and consistent UI.

## UX Flow & Camera Modes

The navigation system will feature three distinct camera modes with smooth, cinematic transitions between them:

1.  **Galaxy View**: A top-down, strategic, node-based view of the player's solar systems and their neighbors. This is the primary view for galaxy-level management and navigation.
2.  **Solar System View**: An orbital view of a single solar system, allowing players to see the planets, moons, and other celestial bodies.
3.  **Planet View (Third-Person)**: A 3D, third-person perspective that allows players to walk around on the surface of a planet and observe the civilization. This is the primary view for planetary management and raids.

## Controls

-   **Seamless Zoom**: Players should be able to smoothly zoom in and out, transitioning between the different camera modes.
-   **Intuitive Pan and Orbit**: The controls for panning and orbiting the camera should be consistent and easy to use across all camera modes.
-   **Collision Detection**: The camera should not be able to clip through planets or other celestial bodies. In the third-person Planet View, the camera should not be able to go through walls or other solid objects.
-   **Camera Limits**: To manage performance, the camera's movement may be limited to a certain distance from the player's home solar system or a selected "point of interest."

## UI Principles & Components

-   **Consistency**: Use a component-based approach to ensure a consistent look and feel across the entire game.
-   **Performance**: The UI must not impact the game's performance. It should be lightweight and optimized.
-   **Responsiveness**: The UI must be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios.
-   **User-Friendliness**: The UI should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and provide clear feedback to the player.
-   **View Switching**: The UI must provide a clear and easy-to-use method for switching between the Galaxy, Solar System, and Planet views.
-   **Heads-Up Display (HUD)**: The HUD should adapt to the current camera view.
    -   *Galaxy View HUD*: Shows high-level information about the player's empire, clan activity, and incoming raids.
    -   *Planet View HUD*: Shows information about the current planet, its resources, and civilization.
-   **Targeting and Selection**: The UI must provide a way for players to select and interact with objects in the universe (solar systems, planets, units).
-   **Search and Bookmarks**: For a large universe, a search function and the ability to bookmark locations are essential.

## Platform-Specific Considerations

-   **Input Methods**: The UI must support a variety of input methods, including mouse and keyboard, touch, and gamepad.
-   **Native UI Elements**: Where appropriate, use native UI elements to provide a more familiar experience for the user on different platforms (e.g., date pickers, file dialogs).

-   **Streaming**: The game must stream in assets and data as the player moves through the universe. This is essential for managing memory and maintaining a smooth frame rate.
-   **Level of Detail (LOD)**: A robust LOD system is required to reduce the complexity of distant objects. In the Galaxy View, entire solar systems may be represented by a single icon or a simplified model.
-   **Occlusion Culling**: The rendering engine should use occlusion culling to avoid rendering objects that are hidden behind other objects.
