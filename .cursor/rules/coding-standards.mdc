# JavaScript Coding & Commenting Standards

This document outlines the coding standards for all JavaScript files in the project. Adherence to these standards is mandatory for maintaining code quality and readability.

## File Size and Complexity

-   **Maximum 500 lines per file**: Including comments and whitespace. Files exceeding this limit must be refactored.
-   **Target 300-400 lines**: Strive for smaller, more manageable files.
-   **Split large files**: Use logical sub-modules to break down complex files.

## Documentation & Commenting

### Principles of Good Comments

-   **Explain "Why," Not "What"**: Your code should be self-documenting in *what* it is doing. Comments should explain *why* a particular implementation was chosen.
-   **Keep Comments Up to Date**: An incorrect comment is worse than no comment at all.
-   **Avoid Obvious Comments**: Do not write comments that state the obvious (e.g., `// This is a loop`).

### Comment Style

-   **JSDoc**: All public methods, classes, and functions must have JSDoc comments.
-   **Inline Comments**: Use `//` for single-line comments for complex or non-obvious logic.
-   **Multi-line Comments**: Use `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.
-   **Complete Sentences**: Write in complete sentences with proper grammar and punctuation.

### File Header

Every `.js` file must start with a file header block explaining its purpose.

```javascript
/**
 * @file FileName.js
 * @description A brief description of the file's purpose.
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @author AstroGarden Development Team
 * @created YYYY-MM-DD
 * 
 * @purpose A more detailed explanation of what this file is for.
 * @dependencies List of other modules or libraries this file depends on.
 * @exports What the module exports (e.g., ClassName class).
 */
```


This rule is based on the [ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:ARCHITECTURE.md) and [dev-workflow.js](mdc:dev-workflow.js) files.
