# Scaffolding Guide

This guide provides templates and standardized procedures for creating new content for **Galactic Clans**. Following these steps will ensure that new assets and game elements are integrated consistently and efficiently.

## Why Use Scaffolding?

-   **Consistency**: Ensures all content follows the same structure and naming conventions.
-   **Efficiency**: Speeds up the process of adding new content by providing a clear starting point.
-   **Scalability**: Makes it easier to manage a large and growing library of assets.

## Scaffolding a New Planet

To create a new planet, follow these steps:

1.  **Create Directory**: Create a new folder under `/src/universes/GalacticCore/planets/` named `PlanetXXX` (e.g., `Planet002`).
2.  **Add Assets**:
    -   Add the planet's model as `model.glb`.
    -   Create a `textures` subfolder for any unique textures.
3.  **Create Config File**: Create a `config.json` file in the planet's directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Arid World",
  "type": "Desert",
  "resource_modifiers": {
    "minerals": 1.2,
    "energy": 0.8
  },
  "max_building_slots": 12,
  "tags": ["hot", "dry"]
}
```

## Scaffolding a New Character/Unit

1.  **Create Directory**: Create a new folder under `/src/universes/GalacticCore/characters/` named after the unit (e.g., `RocketTrooper`).
2.  **Add Assets**:
    -   Add the character's model as `model.glb`.
    -   Create an `animations` subfolder and add animation files (e.g., `idle.glb`, `attack.glb`).
3.  **Create Config File**: Create a `config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Rocket Trooper",
  "type": "Ranged Infantry",
  "stats": {
    "health": 150,
    "attack": 25,
    "range": 5,
    "speed": 1.2
  },
  "training_cost": {
    "minerals": 100,
    "energy": 50
  },
  "target_priority": ["Defensive", "Other"]
}
```

## Using Scaffolding Scripts (Future)

To further streamline this process, we will develop a set of command-line scripts.

-   `npm run scaffold:planet --name="Ice World"`
-   `npm run scaffold:unit --name="Stealth Tank"`

These scripts will automatically create the directory structure and default config files, ready for the artists and designers to populate.
