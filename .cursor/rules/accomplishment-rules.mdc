# Accomplishment Rules

Accomplishments, such as achievements, quests, and other goals, are a key part of the player experience. They provide a sense of progression and reward players for their time and effort.

## Design Principles

-   **Clear and Achievable Goals**: The requirements for each accomplishment must be clear and achievable. Players should know exactly what they need to do to earn it.
-   **Meaningful Rewards**: The rewards for completing an accomplishment should be satisfying and valuable to the player. Rewards can be cosmetic, functional, or a combination of both.
-   **Variety**: Provide a wide variety of accomplishments to cater to different playstyles. This should include short-term, long-term, and hidden goals.
-   **Trackable Progress**: Players must be able to easily track their progress towards an accomplishment. A dedicated UI for tracking achievements and quests is required.
-   **Non-Intrusive**: Accomplishments should enhance the gameplay experience, not feel like a grind. They should be integrated naturally into the core gameplay loop.
