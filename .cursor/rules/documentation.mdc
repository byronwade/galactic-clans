# Documentation Rules

Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for maintaining a large and complex project. All contributions must adhere to these documentation standards.

## Code-Level Documentation

-   **File Headers**: Every file must begin with a header comment that describes the file's purpose, author, and creation date.
-   **Function and Class Headers**: All public functions and classes must have a header comment that explains what the function or class does, its parameters, and what it returns.
-   **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious sections of code.

## Project-Level Documentation

-   **README.md Files**: Every major directory must contain a `README.md` file that provides an overview of the directory's contents and purpose.
-   **Architecture Document**: The `ARCHITECTURE.md` file must be kept up to date. Any significant changes to the project's architecture must be reflected in this document.
-   **Design Documents**: For major new features, a design document must be created. This document should outline the feature's requirements, design, and implementation plan.

## API Documentation

-   **JSDoc**: All public APIs must be documented using JSDoc. This allows for the automatic generation of a comprehensive API reference.
