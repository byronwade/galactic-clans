# Game Functionality & Player Journey

These rules provide a framework for designing game mechanics and systems that are fun, engaging, and balanced, based on the "Galactic Clans" concept. Our goal is to take players on an epic journey from a single solar system to a sprawling galactic empire.

## The Player's Journey

1.  **The First Star**: Players begin with a single, resource-rich solar system. The early game is focused on building basic infrastructure, understanding the core mechanics, and learning how to manage resources.
2.  **Expansion & Exploration**: As players progress, they will unlock the ability to explore and colonize new solar systems. This phase of the game is about expanding their territory, discovering new technologies, and interacting with other players.
3.  **The Rise of Clans**: The mid-game introduces the concept of clans, where players can team up to share resources, coordinate attacks, and participate in large-scale events.
4.  **Galactic Domination**: The end-game is focused on large-scale clan warfare, epic raids, and the struggle for galactic domination. The most powerful clans will be able to control entire regions of the galaxy.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1.  **Idle Production**: Planets generate resources over time. This is the foundation of the player's economy.
2.  **Stabilization**: Players must periodically collect resources to prevent production decay and maintain efficiency. This encourages active engagement.
3.  **Raiding**: Players can deploy their armies to raid other players' planets for resources. This is the primary form of PvP interaction.
4.  **Upgrading**: Players use resources to upgrade their planets, armies, and defenses. This is the core progression mechanic.

## Idle & Raid Flow

-   **Offline Progression**: Resources are generated while the player is offline, up to a certain cap.
-   **Raid Deployment**: Players can drag and drop their army units onto an enemy's planet to initiate a raid.
-   **Server-Validated Raids**: The outcome of a raid is calculated on the client for immediate feedback, but the final result is validated by the server to prevent cheating.

## Player Progression

-   **Solar System Expansion**: Players progress by building and upgrading their solar systems.
-   **Clan-Based Progression**: Players can form clans to participate in large-scale raids and events, and to share buffs and resources.
