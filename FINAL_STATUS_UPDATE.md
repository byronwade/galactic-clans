# 🎉 FINAL STATUS UPDATE - All Systems Operational

## ✅ RESOLUTION COMPLETE

**All configuration issues have been resolved! Both web and desktop applications are now fully functional.**

### 🔧 Issues Fixed

1. **Next.js Configuration Error**: 
   - **Problem**: Next.js was configured for static export (`output: "export"`) which caused development server issues
   - **Solution**: Updated `next.config.mjs` to remove static export settings for proper development mode
   - **Result**: ✅ Next.js development server now runs correctly

2. **Cache Conflicts**: 
   - **Problem**: Old cache files were causing routing and compilation issues
   - **Solution**: Cleared `.next/` and `dist/` directories completely
   - **Result**: ✅ Clean builds and proper page routing

3. **Port Conflicts**: 
   - **Problem**: Multiple Next.js instances trying to use port 3000
   - **Solution**: Killed all existing processes and restarted cleanly
   - **Result**: ✅ Single, stable development server
